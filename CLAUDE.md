# Project notes for Claude Code

Vital Fusion Coaching (vitalfusioncoaching.com): online fitness coaching. The owner
is not a developer; explain changes plainly and keep the site simple.

- Stack: Next.js (App Router, TypeScript), plain CSS in `app/globals.css` (no Tailwind),
  hosted on Vercel. Email via Resend REST API (`lib/email.ts`), optional Supabase via
  REST (`lib/store.ts`). Avoid adding dependencies unless they clearly earn their place.
- The homepage is a sales page for the coaching application only (no free resources /
  blueprint). Every CTA goes to `/apply`. The hero contains question 1 (age): tapping an age
  links to `/apply?age=…`, which starts the form at question 2. A phone-only sticky Apply bar
  (`app/components/StickyApply.tsx`) appears after the hero scrolls away.
- All homepage copy lives in `content/site.ts`; layout in `app/page.tsx`; promo landing page in
  `app/vital-method/`. Images are in `public/images/`. Only add real client results and testimonials.
- CSS is phone-first: base rules are for phones, `@media (min-width: 860px)` for desktop.
  Keep the page lean (short copy, proof early, one repeated CTA).
- `/next-steps` is a hidden (noindex, not in nav) page linked only from the applicant
  confirmation email (`applicantEmail` in `lib/email.ts`). Copy in `content/site.ts` → `nextSteps`.
- Old Emergent URLs (/application, /vital-method-application) redirect in `next.config.mjs`.
- The application (`app/apply/ApplyForm.tsx`) is multi-step, one question per screen; step order
  is `STEPS` in `lib/application.ts`. Picking "Other" reveals a required text box (`otherArea`).
- Application questions live only in `lib/application.ts`; the form, validation and
  email all read from it.
- Run `npm test` after touching `lib/`. Run `npm run build` before pushing.
- Planned next: Instagram handle, then later a programs/shop page, Stripe Checkout for meal
  plans and training programs (one-time) and monthly coaching (subscription), with
  Supabase auth + storage so purchased PDFs are only downloadable by buyers.
- Design: dark theme, accent #6a9fc6 with gold #ffe7ab, large mobile-friendly tap targets. Most visitors
  are on phones.
